	<h1>Welcome to Timformation!</h1>
	<article><p>Hi, I'm Tim! Welcome to version 0.1a of Timformation.com. I'm currently beginning the process of earning my AAS in software development at <a href="http://www.scc.spokane.edu" target="_blank">Spokane Community College</a>. Inside of these pages you'll find some information about me: On the resume page, you can see some of the skills I've learned, a bit about my employment and education histories.</p> 
	<p>On my Projects page you can view some of the work I've already completed (I'll be slowly adding items to that list with every class I take) and the objectives of each project. Finally, on my Contact Me page you'll find an avenue for sending me your own contact information, in case you think there's something I can help you with, or if you have some feedback for me (you'll also find ways to get in touch with me directly). <em>Thanks for looking!</em> And remember: <strong>If you have some information that needs to be in formation, contact Timformation.</strong></p>
